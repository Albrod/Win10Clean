# Win10Clean
Cleanup your Windows enviroment!

I have a special upload on my Dropbox account which includes all kinds of small tweaks and fixes for Windows 10. As we all know it comes with a lot of weird stuff.
But I wanted to make it into a real executable instead of about 7 different scripts, which doesn't even handle any possible errors or whatever - and I wanted to release it for other people to use it. So here it is!

It does not have any functions to disable Windows 10 spying, look somewhere else!

# Todo
Here is progress, here is the list of what needs to be done and what is. This is not stuff I need to come up solutions with, I already have what I need - I am currently porting code over.
- [x] OneDrive uninstaller
- [x] Metero / Win10 app uninstaller
- [x] Remove misc folders from My Pc
- [ ] Update checker
- [ ] Ability to disable HomeGroup (cuz i don't use it)
- [ ] Windows Defender disabler (cuz i'm using malwarebytes)
- [x] GameDVR disabler (uninstalling the Xbox app doesn't stop it)
- [ ] Undo / "go back" button
- [ ] Treat possible errors, and seal of code (with Try, Catch)
