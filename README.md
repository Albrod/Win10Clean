# About
Cleanup your Windows enviroment!

I have a special upload on my Dropbox account which includes all kinds of small tweaks and fixes for Windows 10. As we all know it comes with a lot of weird stuff.
But I wanted to make it into a real executable instead of about 7 different scripts, which doesn't even handle any possible errors or whatever - and I wanted to release it for other people to use it. So here it is!

It does not have any functions to disable Windows 10 spying, for that stuff you'll have to look somewhere else.

#Download
Runnable executables are available [here](https://github.com/ElPumpo/Win10Clean/releases).

#Requirements
+ Windows 10, 8.1 and 8 are all supported
+ .NET framework 4.6

# Todo
Here is progress, here is the list of what needs to be done and what is. This is not stuff I need to come up solutions with, I already have what I need - I am currently porting code over.
- [x] OneDrive uninstaller
- [x] Metero / Win10 app uninstaller
- [x] Remove misc folders from My Pc
- [ ] Update checker
- [ ] Ability to disable HomeGroup (cuz i don't use it)
- [x] Windows Defender disabler (cuz i'm using malwarebytes) - 171f008
- [x] GameDVR disabler (uninstalling the Xbox app doesn't stop it)
- [ ] Undo / "go back" button
- [ ] Treat possible errors, and seal of code (with Try, Catch)
- [ ] Project icon
